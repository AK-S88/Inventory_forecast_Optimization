# 📦 Inventory Forecast Optimization – Python & SAP BI (Simulated Data)

This project demonstrates how predictive analytics and supply chain simulations can optimize inventory management and improve forecasting accuracy. The analysis uses simulated data modeled after real-world manufacturing environments, with a focus on semiconductor-style supply chain complexity.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

- **Objective:** Forecast demand and optimize inventory using statistical models and machine learning (ARIMA & LSTM).
- **Tools Used:** Python, Pandas, ARIMA (statsmodels), LSTM (TensorFlow), Tableau (dashboard), Matplotlib, SAP BI logic.
- **Focus Product:** A1 from a simulated fab-based inventory dataset.

---

## 🗃️ Dataset

- `inventory_data.csv`: Contains current inventory, safety stock, reorder points, and lead times for various products.
- `demand_signals.csv`: Contains weekly demand forecasts for each product over a 52-week period.

## 📈 KPIs (Product A1)

| KPI                   | Value       | Definition                                                                 |
|------------------------|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Stockout Rate**      | 96.15%      | % of weeks when demand couldn’t be met due to low inventory                 |
| **Average Inventory**  | 3.94 units  | Average number of units available across all weeks                          |
| **Reorder Frequency**  | 51 times    | Number of reorder events triggered based on reorder points                 |
| **Service Level**      | 3.85%       | % of weeks where full demand was met                                       |

> ⚠️ High stockout rate and low service level indicate poor planning despite frequent reorders. Forecasting is essential.

## 📉 ARIMA Demand Forecast

- ARIMA(1,1,1) model was trained on 80% of the data.
- Forecasted demand closely followed the actual trend with a Root Mean Squared Error (**RMSE**) of ~22 units.

## 🤖 LSTM Forecast (Neural Network)

- An LSTM model (4-week lookback) was trained to capture temporal patterns.
- Prediction curve aligns closely with the real demand but requires more data and tuning for production use.

## 📊 Visualizations

- **Inventory vs Forecasted Demand:** Time-based view of inventory depletion vs demand signal.
- **KPI Bar Chart:** Summarizes the simulation outcomes (stockouts, reorders, service rate).

## 📁 How to Run

1. Clone this repo or upload files to Colab.
2. Install requirements: `pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn statsmodels scikit-learn`
3. For LSTM: `pip install tensorflow`
4. Run the notebook: `inventory_forecast_model.ipynb`

---

## ✅ Outcome

This simulation-based approach reveals how analytics and forecasting improve supply chain reliability. By integrating forecasting with inventory optimization logic, planners can balance reordering, avoid stockouts, and increase service levels in manufacturing environments.
